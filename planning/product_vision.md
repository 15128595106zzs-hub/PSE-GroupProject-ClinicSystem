# Product: Student Appointment Booking System
## 1. Project Goal (SDG 3)
To achieve the theme of SDG3: Good Health and Well-Being, we hope to help students access the healthcare services they need in a timely manner through effective digital support.
## 2. Problems
Currently, students at the university clinic face long wait times and an inefficient manual booking process, which can delay necessary medical attention.
## 3. Proposed Solution
A web-based appointment booking prototype
It could：
* Book, reschedule, or cancel appointments
* View doctor availability in real-time
* Receive digital confirmation and reminders
## 4. Target Audience
University students and clinic staffs
